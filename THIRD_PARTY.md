# Third-Party Notices and Licenses

dvlt.cu is a bare-metal CUDA/C++ port of NVIDIA's DVLT (Déjà View Looping
Transformer). The port itself is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0

against, and the upstream projects whose algorithms it reimplements.

The DVLT model weights are NOT part of this project; see NOTICE.

## 2. Adapted algorithm lineage (reimplemented, not copied)

This port reimplements DVLT's inference path. DVLT in turn adapts code from the
projects below; the corresponding algorithms are reimplemented here from DVLT's
Apache-2.0 sources — no upstream source code is copied into this repository.
License designations are as recorded in DVLT's `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`, which
is the authoritative per-file attribution map.

| Component | Upstream | License |
|---|---|---|
| DINOv2 ViT backbone (image encoder) | github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2 | Apache-2.0 |
| PyTorch3D (quaternion to rotation matrix) | github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d | BSD-3-Clause |
| MoGe (normalized UV grid) | github.com/microsoft/MoGe | MIT |
| MultiNeRF (camera utilities) | github.com/google-research/multinerf | Apache-2.0 |
| Depth-Anything-3 (ray utilities) | github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Depth-Anything-3 | Apache-2.0 |
| AnyCalib (camera manifold) | github.com/javrtg/AnyCalib | Apache-2.0 |

Note: DVLT also contains four VGGT-licensed files, but they are training/loss
code only and are NOT part of this inference port, so the VGGT License does not
apply here.
